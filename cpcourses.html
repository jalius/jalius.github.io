								<h3>Inspiration</h3>
								<p>The EE department at my school had a special policy of not allowing a waitlist for classes with labs. During registration time, I was spending a lot of time checking the course registration page for classes. Therefore, I decided to make an automated tool that would check the course registration page and send notifications to my phone if new openings appeared.

									<figcaption class="align-center">Public class search endpoint.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<h3>Program Design</h3>

								<p>While I was only really looking for EE classes for a quarter, I wanted the program to work for students in other departments and for future years. Therefore, I designed the program to be configurable between catalog years and departments, by a user configuration file. The program was also designed to run 24/7 on a dedicated server, so it was implemented as a CLI Python program.
								</p>

								</figure>
								<p>I decided to have the program run on Google Cloud Compute Engine servers, because they offered 24/7 use of a low-power server as part of the serviceâ€™s free tier.
								</p>


								<figure class="image medium">
									<img src="images/cpcourses/google_VM_CPCS.png" alt="" />
									<figcaption class="align-center">Google Cloud VM dashboard, used to run the class search tool 24hrs daily</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>Using a standard Linux distribution with systemd, I created a startup and monitoring service that would keep the class search tool running and handle auto-restarting.
								</p>

								<div class="image medium">
									<div class=""><img src="images/cpcourses/systemctl_status_CPCS.png" alt="" /></div>
									<figcaption class="align-center">Class search tool up and running on the VM.</figcaption>
								</div>
							
								<h3>Final Product</h3>

								<div class="image small">
									<div class=""><img src="images/cpcourses/app_notifications.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<figcaption class="align-center">Class search tool phone notifications with Pushover.net</figcaption>
								</div>

								<p>The final program was able to help me find classes for 3 quarters in a row. First I could configure the classes I wanted, then I would receive phone notifications whenever seats opened up. The program should continue to work as long as the course registration page is not significantly changed.
								</p>
