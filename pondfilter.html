									<h1>Pump Filter</h1>
									<p>Jalius Welch</p>
								</header>
								<h3>Need</h3>
								<p>This project was a collaboration with my school's experimental farming club: a solar powered pond project was being created using a pond pump and bog-style filter. <b>The problem:</b> the pump didn't have a catchment filter and kept clogging, causing the water to stagnate. I designed and manufactured a removable mesh screen for the pump that filters out large organic debris and allows for easy maintenance.</p>

									<figcaption class="align-center">This is the pond area, which has leaves and other organic debris.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>As seen in the photos, the pond area was covered in leaves and other organic debris, making it necessary to filter the water before it could be recirculated.</p>

								<h3>Design</h3>
								<p>I initially wanted to design the filter to be one piece that press fit onto the barb attachment of the pump. However, after an inital prototype I decided that it would be better if the filter was removable, and accessible from the top side, which would allow for easy cleaning and access to the filter material for replacement in the future.</p>

										<figcaption class="align-center">Filter with lid.</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>



								<p>The final design of the filter included a screw on lid that allowed access through the wide top section for removing debris and changing the filter mesh.</p>

									<figcaption class="align-center">Top view of the filter 3D model.</figcaption>
								</div>
								<p>The 3D model of the filter was designed to be parametric for simplifying changes to dimensions. A dimensions spreadsheet was used to change the filter's 3D model's dimensions to fit the specific needs of the project.</p>

								</div>

								<p>I made multiple revisions to the dimensions of the filter, and I was satisfied with the design shown above. Once cut to size, the wire mesh screen coils and fits into the filter nicely.</p>

								<p>This project was a fun, engaging exercise in designing and manufacturing a functional and serviceable part. The pond pump works much better now that it has a debris filter, and maintenance of the filter should be simplified due to the design.</p>
