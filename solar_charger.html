								<h3>Design</h3>
								<p>The solar phone charger project is a senior design project that I completed as part of my Power Electronics II class. The assignment was to design a power electronic DC-DC converter that was capable of converting 20V from a solar panel to 5V 10W power that would be used to charge a phone via USB.</p>

								<p>The board was constrained to 50mm x 100mm and the component packages were to be SMD. I selected a buck IC with PWM and internal switches, to reduce part count. The buck IC I selected also had an SOT23 package, which I selected over the smaller SOTs and BGA for the ease of hand-soldering for prototyping. This was the first time I've done layout for a high-frequency converter circuit, I followed the reference design from the buck-converter IC datasheet. This called for a straight shot between Vin and Vout, and large power tracks, to minimize inductance in the power path. I selected the remaining components to fit the design equations and recommendations in the buck's datasheet. </p>

								<h3>Production</h3>
								<p>After the layout was completed, I checked the net connections and trace widths, verified the design with my instructor and then sent the gerber and drill files to the board manufacturing plant.</p>

								<p>The final board arrived, and I hand-soldered the components onto the board without too much trouble, and proceeded to test the connections. Once the board was assembled, I ran open circuit and loaded tests to confirm the circuit met the rated specifications.</p>

								<p>The board performed well in practical tests, and was able to charge a cell phone at 5V/250mA. The final board met all the specifications except for voltage regulation (coming in at 4%, over the specified 3%), while input and output voltages (22V in-max and 5V out), line regulation (<1%), and efficiency (87%) were met.</p>
